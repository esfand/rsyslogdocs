# Elasticsearch Output Module - omelasticsearch #



This module provides native support for logging to Elasticsearch.

Action Parameters:

* **server**    
Host name or IP address of the Elasticsearch server. Defaults to "localhost"
* **serverport**    
HTTP port to connect to Elasticsearch. Defaults to 9200
* **searchIndex**    
Elasticsearch index to send your logs to. Defaults to "system"
* **dynSearchIndex** <on/off>    
Whether the string provided for searchIndex should be taken as a template. 
Defaults to "off", which means the index name will be taken literally. 
Otherwise, it will look for a template with that name, and the resulting string will be the index name. 
For example, let's assume you define a template named "date-days" containing "%timereported:1:10:date-rfc3339%". 
Then, with dynSearchIndex="on", if you say searchIndex="date-days", each log will be sent to 
and index named after the first 10 characters of the timestamp, like "2013-03-22".
* **searchType**    
Elasticsearch type to send your index to. Defaults to "events"
* **dynSearchType** <on/off>    
Like dynSearchIndex, it allows you to specify a template for searchType, instead of a static string.
* **asyncrepl** <on/off>    
By default, an indexing operation returns after all replica shards have indexed the document. 
With asyncrepl="on" it will return after it was indexed on the primary shard only - thus 
trading some consistency for speed.
* **timeout**    
How long Elasticsearch will wait for a primary shard to be available for indexing your 
log before sending back an error. Defaults to "1m".
* **template**    
This is the JSON document that will be indexed in Elasticsearch. The resulting string needs to be 
a valid JSON, otherwise Elasticsearch will return an error. Defaults to:

    $template JSONDefault, 
    "{\"message\":\"%msg:::json%\",\"fromhost\":\"%HOSTNAME:::json%\",
    \"facility\":\"%syslogfacility-text%\",
    \"priority\":\"%syslogpriority-text%\",
    \"timereported\":\"%timereported:::date-rfc3339%\",
    \"timegenerated\":\"%timegenerated:::date-rfc3339%\"}"

Which will produce this sort of documents (pretty-printed here for readability):

    {
        "message": " this is a test message",
        "fromhost": "test-host",
        "facility": "user",
        "priority": "info",
        "timereported": "2013-03-12T18:05:01.344864+02:00",
        "timegenerated": "2013-03-12T18:05:01.344864+02:00"
    }

* **bulkmode** <on/off>    
The default "off" setting means logs are shipped one by one. Each in its own HTTP request, 
using the Index API. Set it to "on" and it will use Elasticsearch's Bulk API to send 
multiple logs in the same request. The maximum number of logs sent in a single bulk request 
depends on your queue settings - usually limited by the dequeue batch size. More information 
about queues can be found here.
* **parent**    
Specifying a string here will index your logs with that string the parent ID of those logs. Please note that you need to define the parent field in your mapping for that to work. By default, logs are indexed without a parent.
* **dynParent** <on/off>
Using the same parent for all the logs sent in the same action is quite unlikely. So you'd probably want to turn this "on" and specify a template that will provide meaningful parent IDs for your logs.
* **uid**    
If you have basic HTTP authentication deployed (eg: through the elasticsearch-basic plugin), you can specify your user-name here.
* **pwd**    
Password for basic authentication.
Samples:

The following sample does the following:

loads the omelasticsearch module
outputs all logs to Elasticsearch using the default settings
module(load="omelasticsearch")
*.*     action(type="omelasticsearch")

The following sample does the following:

loads the omelasticsearch module
defines a template that will make the JSON contain the following properties (more info about what properties you can use here):
RFC-3339 timestamp when the event was generated
the message part of the event
hostname of the system that generated the message
severity of the event, as a string
facility, as a string
the tag of the event
outputs to Elasticsearch with the following settings
host name of the server is myserver.local
port is 9200
JSON docs will look as defined in the template above
index will be "test-index"
type will be "test-type"
activate bulk mode. For that to work effectively, we use an in-memory queue that can hold up to 5000 events. The maximum bulk size will be 300
retry indefinitely if the HTTP request failed (eg: if the target server is down)
