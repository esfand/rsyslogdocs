= Message Flow

== Message Flow
Depending on their module type, modules may access and/or modify messages at various stages 
during rsyslog's processing. Note that only the "core type" (e.g. input, output) but not any 
type derived from it (message modification module) specifies when a module is called.

== Simplified Workflow
.The simplified workflow is as follows

"Message Flow",link="http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/module_workflow.png"]

As can be seen, messages are received by input modules, then passed to one or many parser 
modules, which generate the in-memory representation of the message and may also modify the 
message itself. The, the internal representation is passed to output modules, which may 
output a message and (with the interfaces newly introduced in v5) may also modify messageo 
object content.

String generator modules are not included inside this picture, because they are not a 
required part of the workflow. If used, they operate "in front of" the output modules, 
because they are called during template generation.

Note that the actual flow is much more complex and depends a lot on queue and filter settings.
