= Contributing to the Rsyslog Documentations

The [productname]#Rsyslog# documentation project uses a _docbook_ toolchain to generate the documentation.  
We are generating our docbook xml from _asciidoc_ source.

== Building the Rsyslog docs

To build the Rsyslog documentations, execute the following command:

. Generate the PDF, html_single, and html files
+
With the docbook generated we can execute our docbook toolchain to generate the PDF, html_single, 
and html files using the maven build.
+
----
mvn clean install
----

== Editing the documentation using guard and livereload

The asciidoc source can be edited using any text editor.  However, if you'd like re receive rapid feedback on how the
docs are evolving, you can enable guard and livereload to see your changes live in your browser.

To use guard and livereload with the Rsyslog docs, follow the following steps

[NOTE]
====
These aren't meant to be exhaustive steps for installing and configuring guard and livereload, rather it's a recipe of
how to use these tools as they are configured for working with the Rsyslog docs.  For more detailed instructions, 
see this excellent resource: http://asciidoctor.org/docs/editing-asciidoc-with-live-preview/
====

. Initialize your ruby environment
+
[NOTE]
====
Make sure you have ruby >= 1.9.2 installed, and the +bundle+ gem.  You will also need the livereload plugin installed
in your browser.
====
+
The docs come with a bundled +Gemfile+ that is used to initialize your ruby environment as follows:
+
----
bundle install
----

. Start guard
+
The docs come pre-configured with a Guardfile used to configure guard to listen for asciidoc changes, and generate 
html directly using asciidoctor.  To run guard do:
+
----
bundle exec guard start
----

. Connect your browser
+
Connect your browser to livereload by navigating to either of the files: 
+
--
.. [filename]+Rsyslog_Reference/target/docbook/en-US/Rsyslog_Reference.html+
.. [filename]+Rsyslog_Guide/target/docbook/en-US/Rsyslog_Guide.html+
--
+
Then activate the livereload plugin in your browser.  As you save changes to the asciidoc source, you will see those
changes reflected in the browser within seconds.
